<h2 class="mb-3 fs-2">Site Overview</h2>

<p class="lead">Sites and locations are meant for facilities with multiple physical locations. With Cubikil you can manage multiple locations all under one company. It’s important to note that there’s a distinct difference between Company’s and Sites.</p>

<p class="lead">Company’s are used when you have storage multiple storage facilities with different company names, directors, managers and owners. Whereas sites are used when your company owns multiple locations. For example: ABC Storage Washington, ABC Storage New York and ABC Storage New Mexico would use one company with multiple sites. </p>

<p class="lead">ABC Storage Toronto, Epic Storage Knoxville and PRD Self Storage would use separate company profiles within the Cubikil System. </p>

<p class="lead mb-4">Below is an example of a storage facility that has one site added to the Cubikil system. There are not limits to how many sites you can add. </p>

  <b class="mx-2">Important!</b>
Always make sure to check with your account manager when adding a site. Chances are that your new facility might benefit from being created as a separate company in the Cubikil system.
