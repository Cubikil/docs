<h2 class="mb-3 fs-2">Unit Group Overview</h2>

<p class="lead mb-4">Unit groups are meant to group together units that are alike. This feature comes in very handy when grouping together unit sizes, unit amenities, outdoor storage or even grouping units based on facility floors (i.e., first floor or second floor). Below is an example of a few unit groups that were created to group together a few storage units.</p>

<h3 class="mb-3 fs-5">Unit Group Name</h3>
<p class="lead mb-4">This refers to the actual name that you would give the unit group. <b>Make sure to keep your naming convention clean and to the point</b>. Above is a great example of proper unit group naming based on unit sizes. </p>

<h3 class="mb-3 fs-5">Unit Group Description</h3>
<p class="lead mb-4">With Unit Group descriptions, we recommend adding a paragraph of text with details about the unit group. This can be especially important when a facility is managed by more than one person.</p>

  <b class="mx-2">Important!</b>
Do not get unit amenities and unit groups mixed up. They can essentially serve as the same purpose however, unit amenities are specifically designed to assign features to a unit.

<div class="alert bg-warning text-dark mb-5" role="alert">
<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation"></i>
  <b class="mx-2">Notice!</b>
We’ve seen many times in the past that storage facility’s do not pay attention to their storage unit groups. We highly recommend that you keep your unit groups as organized as possible.
