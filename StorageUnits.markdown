<h3 class="mb-3 fs-5">Rentable Unit Icon</h3>
<p class="lead mb-4">The unit icon is directly connected to the unit type. This also reflects on your front-facing website if you opt-in for our WordPress plugin. The icon changes if you modify or change the rentable units’ unit type. </p>

<h3 class="mb-3 fs-5">Rentable Unit Name</h3>

<p class="lead">Naming convention on a rentable unit is very important. Always start with the floor number and then the actual number of the unit. If your facility has 2 story/floors, then the ground or first floor units will start with 1. The second-floor units will start with 2 and so on. For example, Unit 101 will be the first unit on the first floor. Whereas Unit 201 would be the first unit on the second floor.</p>
<p class="lead mb-4">Make sure to accommodate for total number of units you have in your entire facility (Site or Location) when naming your storage units. For example, if you have 100 units then your naming conversion of your units would be Unit 1001. Second floor would be 2001 and so on. If you have a 1000 unit facility then your naming convention of your units would be 10001, second floor would be 20001 and so on.</p>

  <b class="mx-2">Notice!</b>
It's advisable to add a Unit Group for each story/floor you have in your facility. For example, If you have a facility with 3 story/floors, then add 1st Floor Units, Floor 2nd Floor Units and 3rd Floor Units.

<h3 class="mb-3 fs-5">Rentable Unit Name with multiple sites or locations</h3>
<p class="lead mb-4">If your company owns more than one site or location, we highly recommend you add the letter of the storage site name at the start of your naming convention. For example, K-Unit 3234. The K represents the site name in this case it’s Knoxville. The number 3 represents 3rd floor and the last 3 digits, the actual storage unit number. Which in this case would be 234.</p>
