<h3 class="mb-3 fs-5">Rentable Unit Name</h3>

<p class="lead">Naming convention on a rentable unit is very important. Always start with the floor number and then the actual number of the unit. If your facility has 2 stories or floors, then the ground or first floor units will start with 1. The second-floor units will start with 2 and so on. For example, Unit 101 will be the first unit on the first floor. Whereas Unit 201 would be the first unit on the second floor.</p>

  <b class="mx-2">Notice!</b>
It’s advisable to add a Unit Group for each story or floor you have in your facility. For example, if you have a facility with 3 stories or floors, add 1st Floor Units, 2nd Floor Units, and 3rd floor units.

<h3 class="mb-3 fs-5">Rentable Unit Name with multiple sites or locations</h3>
<p class="lead mb-4">If your company owns more than one site or location, we highly recommend you add the letter of the storage site name at the start of your naming convention. For example, K-Unit 3234. The K represents the site name (in this case it’s Knoxville). The number 3 represents 3rd floor, and the last 3 digits represent the actual storage unit number, which in this case would be 234.</p>

<h3 class="mb-3 fs-5">Rentable Unit Status</h3>
<p class="lead">The unit status on your units is directly associated with your reservations and if the unit has an active Blackout enabled. Units can either be Available, Unavailable or Occupied. </p>
<p class="lead mb-4">The Available status allows users and customers to book a unit based on the availability dates. </p>
<img src="https://assets.cubikil.com/frontend/documentation/available-status.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded-3 shadow-sm mb-4" />
<p class="lead mb-4">Occupied units <b>CANNOT</b> be reserved and will not show up when conducting a unit availability search when booking a reservation. </p>
<img src="https://assets.cubikil.com/frontend/documentation/occupied-status.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded-3 shadow-sm mb-4" />
<p class="lead mb-4">Unavailable units are units that are set to Blackout. This comes in handy when a rentable unit requires maintenance or cleaning. Unavailable units <b>CANNOT</b> be rented out and do not show up in the unit availability search when booking a reservation. </p>
